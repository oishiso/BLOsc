Move the help file with extension .schelp to the Extensions folder in HelpSource/Classes, e.g. /Users/user/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions/HelpSource/ClassesRecompile the class library (Language > Recompile Class Library) and reboot the server within SuperCollider IDE.
In case SuperCollider is unhappy dealing with new UGens, quit SuperCollider and load it again.
